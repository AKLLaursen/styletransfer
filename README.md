# styletransfer

This is a module for doing style transfer using [Keras]() and [TensorFlow](). The work is an implementation of *[Johnson et al. - Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155)* with the improvements suggested by *[Novak & Nikulin - Improving the Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04603)* and optionally *[Gatys et al. - Preserving Color in Neural Artistic Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05897)*.

The final implementation is still work in progress.
